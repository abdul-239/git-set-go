A workflow is an automated process that helps you streamline your tasks—whether it's testing your code, building your project, or deploying a website. Workflows are made up of one or more jobs, and can be triggered by various events.

### How to Deploy a Repository with Static HTML Site Files Using **GitHub WorkFlow**

---

1. **Create a Repository**:
   - Go to GitHub and create a new repository.
   - Name your repository (e.g., `my-static-site`).
   - Initialize the repository with a README file.

---

2. **Add Your Static Site Files**:
   - Clone the repository to your local machine.
   - Add your static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to the repository.
   - Commit and push the changes to GitHub.

---


3. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
   - Go to the repository settings on GitHub.
   - Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.
   - Under "Source", select the branch you want to deploy (e.g., `main` or `master`).
   - If your files are in a folder (e.g., `docs`), select that folder as the source.
   - Click "Save".

---

4. **Access Your Deployed Site**:
   - After a few moments, GitHub will provide a URL where your site is deployed.
   - Visit the URL to see your live static site.

---

5. **Update Your Site**:
   - Make changes to your static site files locally.
   - Commit and push the changes to GitHub.
   - GitHub Pages will automatically update your site with the new changes.

---

In the same way, a GitHub workflow automates tasks for you, like deploying your website without manual effort every time.
